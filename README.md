Coffee Connect is a platform for coffee lovers to discover and explore their favorite drinks from popular chains and local cafes. Users can create accounts and search among many options. The platform provides comprehensive information about ingredients, coffee varieties, sourcing history, and ratings to help users make informed choices.
Based on your comment, I decided to keep everything more feasible. Coffee Connect would be a web base with some coffee information. Also, I will use Flask, so the first step is to define two roots.
